﻿/*
 * The Triangle class

Implement the Triangle class according to the requirements:

    It should contain private fields of integer type representing base and height

    They should be set via the constructor (base should be the first parameter, height should be the second)

    *It should contain a public CalculateArea method, returning the area according to the following formula: ((base * height) / 2)   

    It should contain a public AsString method, which returns a string following this pattern: "Base is B, height is H", where B and H should be switched to values of base and height. So, for example, it could be "Base is 10, height is 5".

IMPORTANT: "base" is a reserved keyword in C#, so having a constructor parameter named "base" will not work. We learned how to bypass it in the "Naming variables & introduction to clean code" lecture.

*The area of a triangle can be a fraction of a number. For example, a triangle of base 1 and height 3 has an area equal to 1.5. We haven't learned about numeric type representing fractions yet, so just use the formula  ((Base * Height) / 2).
*It will trim the result to a whole number, but it is fine for now.
