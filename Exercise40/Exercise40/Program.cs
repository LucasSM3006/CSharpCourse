/*
 * Where & Distinct

Implement the GetFridaysOfYear method, which given a collection of dates and a number representing the year, returns a collection of all dates from this collection that are Fridays (without duplicates).

For example, for the following dates and year 2023:

    24.03.2023 (Friday)

    24.03.2023 (Friday) -> will be excluded as duplicate

    25.03.2023 (Saturday) -> will be excluded as not a Friday

    31.03.2023 (Friday)

    08.03.2024 (Friday) -> will be excluded because it's not from the given year

The result shall be:

    24.03.2023 (Friday)

    31.03.2023 (Friday)

Tip: The DateTime object has a DayOfWeek property of the DayOfWeek enum type.
